# iris-classification-ml-pipeline
This project implements a ML pipeline using Scikit-learn to classify the Iris dataset, which consists of three species of iris flowers based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It includes data loading, standardization, model training with a Random Forest classifier, and evaluation, achieving 100% accuracy.
